Welcome to my Personal Portfolio! 

I am an aspiring front-end developer whoâ€™s passionate about building accessible and user-friendly web applications I specialize in responsive web development with an emphasis on the latest best-practices to create custom websites and web/enterprise applications.

I am a front end developer who comes from a Pastry background where I developed collaborative and problem solving skills. My former career background means that I thrive in a high-paced situation while maintaining efficiency.

I have extensive experience with HTML5, CSS3 (SASS, styled-components), Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), REST APIs, ReactJS, WordPress, mongoDB, Mongoose and web accessibility.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching Netflix series, reading books, and baking.

I'm currently looking for work on a dynamic team. One that believes in the work they do and cares for the people they work alongside. Does this sound like you? Feel free to message me about job opportunities.

Have a nice day ahead!
